# Angle Between Vectors

> **Definition:**  
> The angle between two vectors is given by $\theta$.

> 
> $$
 \cos\theta = \frac{\langle u, v \rangle}{\| u \| \| v \|}
 $$
- This equation allows us to **find the directional relationship** between two vectors.
- If **$\cos\theta = 1$** → Vectors are **parallel**.
- If **$\cos\theta = 0$** → Vectors are **perpendicular**.
- If **$\cos\theta = -1$** → Vectors point in **opposite directions**.

## **Applications**
- Used in [[Cosine Similarity]] to measure **directional similarity**.
- Appears in physics and [[Projection]].
