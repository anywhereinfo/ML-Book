## **Properties of a Norm**
1. **Non-negativity**
	 $$\text{The norm is always non-negative.}$$
	 $$\| u \| \geq 0 $$   $$\text{It is zero only for the zero vector:} \quad \| u \| = 0 \iff u = 0$$
	 
2. **Homogeneity**
    $$\text{Scaling a vector by } \alpha \text{ scales its norm by } | \alpha |.$$
    $$\| \alpha u \| = | \alpha | \| u \|$$
3. **Triangle Inequality**
   $$\| u + v \| \leq \| u \| + \| v \|$$ $$ \text{The length of the sum of two vectors is at most the sum of their lengths.} $$
4. **Definiteness**
   $$\| u \| = 0 \iff u = 0$$ $$\text{Only the zero vector has zero norm.}$$
## **Connection to Inner Product**
- Uses the inner product **to compute magnitude**.
- Appears in **distance formulas** in Euclidean space.
