# Gram-Schmidt Process

> **Definition:**  
> The **Gram-Schmidt process** is a method used to transform a set of **linearly independent** vectors into an **orthonormal** set. This is particularly useful in **linear algebra, machine learning, quantum mechanics, and numerical analysis** when working with bases in vector spaces.
   Orthonormal bases make **calculations easier** because dot products between basis vectors become **0 or 1**.
## **What Does "Orthonormalize" Mean?**

A set of vectors is **orthonormal** if:

1. **Orthogonality** → Each vector is **perpendicular** (dot product = 0) to every other vector in the set.
2. **Normalization** → Each vector has a **unit length** (norm = 1).

The **Gram-Schmidt process** ensures both of these properties by **iteratively constructing an orthonormal basis** from an initial set of linearly independent vectors.
## **Why It Matters**
- Used in **QR decomposition**.
- Creates **orthogonal bases** for vector spaces.
